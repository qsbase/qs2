Description: Streamlines and accelerates the process of saving and loading R objects, improving speed and compression compared to other methods. The package provides two compression formats: the 'qs2' format, which uses R serialization via the C API while optimizing compression and disk I/O, and the 'qdata' format, featuring custom serialization for slightly faster performance and better compression. Additionally, the 'qs2' format can be directly converted to the standard 'RDS' format, ensuring long-term compatibility with future versions of R.
